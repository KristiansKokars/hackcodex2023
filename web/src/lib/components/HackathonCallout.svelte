	><p>This project was made for the awesome HackCodeX hackathon!</p>
	<p>
		Due to that, this prototype is missing many things a real application would have and be secured
		for, so don't be surprised if you find late night bugs here!
	</p>
	<p>
		Authentication is also very lax - it is done by simple username and there are no requirements
		for a password.
	</p>
	<p>Still, I hope you enjoy what we made in this little time!</p>
