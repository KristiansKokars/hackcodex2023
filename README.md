# HackCodeX 2023 ATEA Challenge

All code is very hacky as it was assembled in 2 days and does not represent what we would do in an actual production app (where there would be time to ensure quality instead of "just get it working ASAP")

## Setup

1. Follow the `README.md` in backend and setup the server
2. Follow the `README.md` in web to set it up and point it to the server URL
